Configuration
-----

Rename and edit the following configuration files :

**Config.js**

	assets/js/config.example.js

Must be renamed into

	assets/js/config.js

You'll have to rewrite the paths for the server calls with proper values (for the **URLOptions** item)

**App-config.js**

	assets/js/app-config.example.js

Must be renamed into

	assets/js/app-config.js

You'll have to set the configuration rules for the app :

- Weather the application interface is readonly or not
		
		readonlyMode : true OR false

- Display advanced filters on the left pannel

		displayUserFilter : true OR false
		
- Set the authentication mode

		authMode : "portal" OR anything else
		
- If portal authentication mode is set, indicate the URL linking to the portal

		portalURL : "http://path/to/your/portal/"

- If portal authentication mode is set, the JWT security key 

		securityKey : "yourSecurityKey"
		
- Some paths to reach various webservices :

	- Path leading to thesaurs webservices
		
			thesaurusWSPath : "http://path/to/thesaurus/webservices/"
		
	- Path to the server to get the list of all the form names

			forms : "/path/to/allforms/webservice/"

- The list of all application contexts you want to find in the formbuilder

	**See next chapter** for a full description of what you should put there

- The start ID of the thesaurus for each of your contexts

		startID : {context1 : 0, context2 : 508, ...}


--------------------------------------------------
Contexts Configuration
-----

For the **appMode** option, you will have to indicate the list of contexts you want to see in your formbuilder application.

- First you have to set a topcontext value

		topcontext : "classic"

- Then simply indicate the list of your contexts associated with an array of all the kind of inputs you want to link with your contexts 

		context1 : ['Text', 'Date', 'Number'],
		context2 : ['Select', 'Thesaurus', 'CheckBox', 'Autocomplete'],
		contextZ : ['File', 'Radio']


**Here is the list of existing generic types :**

- Hidden
- HorizontalLine

- Text
- File
- TreeView
- Date
- TextArea
- Number
- Decimal
- NumericRange
- Pattern
