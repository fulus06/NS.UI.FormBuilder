![formBuilder](https://bfc338e5d0f8ee39c10a706464e4731eb4bd4d7a.googledrive.com/host/0B363_4UXLoNhUWhTOWhCbXlQQ2s/form.jpg)

## Features

* Graphical form definition
* Export / Import with JSON or XML file
* Drag'n drop field position ajustement
* Model definition based on backone-forms

## Demo

You can try the formBuilder on [this page](http://naturalsolutions.github.io/NS.UI.FormBuilder/)
That page is static, so some functionnalities like "save on the cloud" will not work.

### Demo FormBuilder to Backbone forms

When you've imported a JSON file, you can try it on this page [FormBuilder to 
Backbone-forms](http://amiceli.github.io/FormBuilderTobackbone-forms/).
You can generate a form with your jSON File.

You can also try [this demo](http://amiceli.github.io/backboneformsWizard/). You can 
generate a form with fieldset and wizard.

##### Currently the FormBuilder is not 100% compatible with backbone forms but it's our goal.
